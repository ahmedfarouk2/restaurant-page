# restaurant-page

Practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage using a module bundler for the first time! (Webpack)

Just load up the HTML and you're good to go!

Worth mentioning that for now, It won't work in mobile as right now in the curriculum it's not teached.

Thanks!
